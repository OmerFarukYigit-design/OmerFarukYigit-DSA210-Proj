# SPOTIFY MUSIC HABITS PROJECT PROPOSAL

# Problem Statement 
With the upsurge of music streaming services, individual music habits have nowadays turned into a gold mine for data that may shed light on a person's preferences and listening behaviors. Among them, Spotify stands tall to study such habits because the detailed data it offers in track, genre, and time format can be highly enriching. This project is based on the exploration of patterns in my Spotify listening history, focusing on which genres and tracks I listen to the most, how these preferences change over time, and how listening habits are influenced by different periods or activities.

# How Will We Address This Problem?
To analyze my Spotify data, I will first extract my listening history using Spotify's data export feature. This data includes but is not limited to track titles, artist names, album names, genres, and timestamps indicating when songs were played. Once the data is retrieved, preprocessing will be done to structure it into an analyzable format. The project will focus on three main steps: exploratory data analysis, visualization, and optionally predictive modeling.

Expressed in other terms, this should give insights about the overall patterns of listening, the preferences for any genres, or changes according to season and days. Visualization would therefore serve the purpose of effectively illustrating insights as graphs or charts for intuitive, quick insight into listening habits. Finally, a predictive model may allow forecasted favorite genres or tracks from historical information that has provided extra insight for predicting behaviors.

# Methods and Tools We Plan to Use
We will be using Spotify's export data feature for collecting data in this project. The analysis and pre-processing will be done in Python using libraries like Pandas and NumPy. Visualization will be performed by the usage of Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot neat and interesting graphs. Also, the work carried out and the findings in the project will be recorded and shared using a GitHub repository.

# Expected Outcome
This project is envisaged to present an exhaustive analysis of my Spotify listening history for valuable insights on my favorite genres, artists, and tracks, coupled with temporal trends in listening. The results will indicate the emerging patterns in music consumption and preference. If predictive modeling is implemented, it will further enhance such analysis by making predictions about future listening behavior based on past trends.
