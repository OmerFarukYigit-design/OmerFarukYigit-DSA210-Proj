SCREEN TIME ANALYSIS PROJECT PROPOSAL

Problem Statement

In the digital era, screen time has become an essential aspect of daily life. However, excessive screen usage may negatively impact productivity, mental health, and overall well-being. Understanding the patterns of screen time usage is crucial for identifying potential areas for improvement and fostering a healthier relationship with technology. By analyzing personal screen time data, we aim to uncover insights into digital habits and explore strategies to optimize them.

How Are We Going To Tackle This Problem?

We will analyze personal screen time data collected from the "Screen Time" feature on an Apple iPhone. The dataset will include daily total usage, app category-based breakdowns (e.g., social media, entertainment, productivity), and hourly usage distribution. By utilizing Python libraries, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends. Visualizations will be created to clearly communicate findings. Additionally, if time allows, a predictive model will be developed to forecast future screen time based on current habits.

Methods and Tools We Are Planning to Use

For this project, the following methods and tools will be employed:
Exploration and Data Analysis: Pandas and NumPy for data processing and analysis.
Visualization: Matplotlib and Plotly for generating insightful graphs and trends.
Prediction (Optional): Scikit-learn to build regression models for predicting future screen time.
Data Collection: Screen time data exported from the iPhone's "Screen Time" feature.

Expected Outcome

By the end of this project, we expect to uncover meaningful insights about personal screen time habits, such as peak usage hours, most used application categories, and potential areas for improvement. The analysis will also propose actionable strategies to reduce unnecessary screen time and enhance productivity. If a predictive model is implemented, it will offer an additional layer of insight by forecasting future screen usage trends.
